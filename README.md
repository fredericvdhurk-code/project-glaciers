# Glacier Mass Balance Analysis with Weather Data

**Analyzing the impact of Temperature and Precipitation on glacier mass balance using historical data.**

---

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the mass balance of glaciers by correlating weather data (temperature and precipitation) with glacier volume changes. The goal is to provide insights into how climate change and weather variability affect glacier health over time. 
The analysis is performed on 8 different glaciers of the swiss alps with help of weather data from 3 different weather stations spread across the relevant regions

## Features
- **Data Integration**: Combines glacier mass balance data with historical time-series weather datasets.
- **Visualization**: Generates plots of mass balance, weather data and relationships.
- **ML Analysis**: Uses linear regression models to quantify the effects of weather components on glacier mass balance.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` for visualization
  - `statsmodels` for statistical modeling
- **Data Sources**:
  - Glacier data: GLAMOS website
  - Weather data: Meteoswiss homogenous weather time-series
